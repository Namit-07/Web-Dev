# 🐦 X.com Clone (Twitter-style UI)

This is a **Twitter / X interface clone** built as part of the **Sigma Web Development Course**.  
It focuses on frontend layout, responsive UI, dynamic feed rendering, and basic post interactions using React + TailwindCSS.

---

## 🏗 Project Overview

This clone replicates key sections of Twitter’s UI — sidebar, feed, tweet input, and trends panel — using modern frontend tech.  
It’s not a full app with backend authentication (yet), but it demonstrates how the UI structure and React logic work in a social feed.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖼 Static feed layout with placeholder posts  
- ✏️ “What’s happening?” input box to post new feed items (dummy)  
- 📋 Dynamic list rendering of feed items  
- 🔁 Conditional rendering (when no posts, show “No Posts Yet”)  
- 📐 Responsive layout with TailwindCSS breakpoints  
- 🎨 Dark mode design by default

### 📚 What I Learned
- Building React components and passing props
- Mapping arrays with map() to render dynamic lists
- Conditional UI with ternary operators & logical rendering
- Styling with Tailwind — utility-first CSS + responsive breakpoints
- Handling user input to dynamically add posts

### 🚀 Next Steps / Improvements
- Integrate with backend (Node + Express + MongoDB) to store posts
- Add authentication / user login
- Add likes, retweets / comments features
- Improve responsiveness on mobile
- Add dark + light mode toggle
- Use CSS transitions / animations for better UI feedback
