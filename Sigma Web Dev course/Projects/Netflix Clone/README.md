# 🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone

A responsive and visually accurate **Netflix landing page clone**, built using **HTML5 and CSS3** only — part of the [CodeWithHarry Sigma Web Dev Course](https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/webdev/).

This project was created to strengthen core web development skills while replicating a real-world, production-grade landing page layout. It's designed with scalability, responsiveness, and clean structure in mind — no frameworks, no shortcuts.
